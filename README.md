#CODSOFT Data Science Internship

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the CODSOFT Data Science Internship.

 Tasks Completed
🔹 Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

Built a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Logistic Regression.
Covered data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

🔹 Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction

Developed a regression model to predict movie ratings based on features like year, duration, genre, votes, director, and actors.
Focused on data preprocessing, encoding categorical data, and model evaluation using MSE and R² score.

🔹 Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

Implemented a classification model to identify Iris flower species using petal and sepal measurements.
Applied label encoding, train-test split, model training, and visualization.
